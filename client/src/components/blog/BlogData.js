      description: 'Marrakech: A Bustling City Filled with Vibrant SouksMarrakech is a vibrant city, one that is bustling, noisy, colourful and vibrant. It is filled with markets, known as souks, and one can literally wander and explore the markets for days.  They are filled with food, drink, jewellery, silver, gold, rugs, leather, art, clothing, souvenirs and everything in-between.  They are a real highlight of Marrakech, and while everyone will get lost in a souk at some point, everyone will love them!Unveiling the Rich Heritage: The Medina’s Ancient Gates and Bustling MarketsThe Medina is the old city and it is alive with markets.  When entering the Medina, there are many gates, all ancient.  Traders used to make their way to the Medina to sell their wares, and one market grew bigger and bigger, today known as Marrakech’s main market.  You can walk and wander for hours, looking, shopping, bargaining, eating and drinking, meeting the locals and wandering some more.Specialised Souks: Carpets, Leather, Shoes, Gold, and SpicesWith time and as Marrakech grew, smaller markets starting springing up.  None of these are exactly small, and they are all worth exploring.  Some souks had specialities, and today you can visit the carpet souk, the leather souk, the shoe souk, the gold souk and the spice souk.  We would suggest you visit them all and they are literally named after what they sell.   It’s a good idea to visit the Medina and main souks with a guide, especially for the first time.  You can join a guided walking tour, private or in a group, and get a real sense of Marrakech’s narrow alleys, colourful markets, interesting architectures and incredible people.',
